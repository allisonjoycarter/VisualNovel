Welcome to my visual novel framework!

To make your own story as a visual novel:
This code uses 3 files. StoryLined, Choices, and Results. These files should all be saved in the VisualNovel folder.
The code reads StoryLined to get lines and display it in the program. However, if it reaches a line that reads "choice"
it will stop and force the user to make a decision. The program uses the Choice file to label the buttons.
Also, if there is a line that reads "resultx", where x is a number (so the first would be result1, then result2, etc.)
the program will refer to the Results file to get a result.

Format of Story file:
Your Story file should be set up so that any lines that you want to appear for ALL story endings/variations are included.
When you reach a point in the story where the user needs to make a choice, just make a line that reads "choice"
in the file and the program will accommodate. Whenever a result needs to be shown, just make a line that reads "resultx"
(where x starts at 1 and increases for each result).

Format of Choices file:
Your Choices file should be set up like so:
FirstSetofChoices1
FirstSetofChoices2

SecondSetofChoices1
SecondSetofChoices2
...and so on.
The program only accomodates for a file set up in this manner. This means only 2 options should be available
for each choice. The program sets a value for each line (and puts it into an array) and sets the buttons to the line at
the value called. So, if the lines are not set up in this manner, they will show incorrectly. This means a line needs
to be included after each set of choices. It's easier to read if it's blank but you can put text there, the program
merely skips over it anyway.

Format of Results file:

Troubleshooting:

If your file(s) cannot be found:
    Make sure the file is saved in the same folder as the program itself. Also make sure the names of these files are
    the same as the original. That is, "StoryLined", "Choices", and "Results". Make sure there is no ".txt" at the end
    of the file name.
