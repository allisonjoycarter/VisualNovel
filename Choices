"Why?"
"That's nice."

"I'm surprised you noticed that."
"It's about time you figured it out."

Tell her to be kinder to Ethan.
Let it go.

Take Chelsea's side
Tell him he's justified

Go for a hug instead
Accept the high five

Ask him to elaborate
Act like I know what he's talking about

"We really should just move on from this."
"I'm upset that we never dated."

Since we hung out
For years

Yes
No

Lean my head on his shoulder
Wait for Ethan to make a move 

I should stop
Kiss him
